This is a simple project for study an application of Contract Factory. A Factory is a contract that creates other contracts.


User Story case:                                                                                                                         An Istitution,School or University can register details of degrees using CertificateFactory to create a contract for their students.   Only the Istitution can create it, because it is the owner of CertificateFactory.

There are dev bootcamp's students with more experience than me. Thanks for your pacience. I can evaluate your projects.
